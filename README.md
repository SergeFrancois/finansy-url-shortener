# URL shortener service
This is a simple web server that allows you to create and use short URLs similar to [Bitly](bitly.com).
Web server is built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) and [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/).
## Installation and run
To run the web server simply clone the repository to a machine with Docker Compose installed (I used version 2.39.1) and enter the command:
```
docker compose up
```
If port 5001 is already occupied by another service, change the port in the [compose](./compose.yaml) file and try again.
## Usage
Documentation on using the web server can be viewed in [Swagger](http://localhost:5001/docs) or [ReDoc](http://localhost:5001/redoc) formats.
Below are several examples of how the web server can be used.
